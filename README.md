# HnatkoSim

HnatkoSim is a platform of simulators for two computational models-**Abacus Machine (AM)** and **Random Access Machine (RAM)**-built in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) as part of a bachelor’s thesis project.

## Overview

**Abacus Machine**  
The abacus machine (from the word “abacus,” meaning “counting device”) is one of the simplest computational models, relying solely on increment and decrement operations. It operates with an unlimited number of registers, each capable of holding arbitrarily large natural numbers.

**Random Access Machine**  
A Random Access Machine (RAM) is a computational model similar to classical sequential computers. It’s often used to study algorithms from the standpoint of computational and space complexity. Programming a RAM is comparable to working with a simplified processor that has a limited instruction set, making it a helpful entry point into assembly-like programming.

Both of these models are **computationally equivalent to a Turing machine**. They are taught in the course _Teoretické základy informatických vied (TZIV)_ at the Faculty of Informatics and Information Technologies in Bratislava.
